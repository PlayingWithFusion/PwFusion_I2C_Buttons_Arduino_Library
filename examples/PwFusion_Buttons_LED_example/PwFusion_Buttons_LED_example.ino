* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* This file contains functions to initialize and run a Playing With Fusion R3aktor in
* order to communicate with the I2C Buttons board. Funcionality is as described below:
*	- Configure R3aktor to receive information from the I2C Buttons board
* - Activate and deactivate select LEDs based on the button being pressed
*	- Broadcast results to COM port
*  Circuit: (see Schematic.png)
*    R3aktor     -->  I2C Buttons
*    Qwiic pins  -->  Qwiic pins
*    R3aktor     -->  LEDS
*    DIO 05      -->  LED 1 in series with 220 ohm resistor
*    DIO 06      -->  LED 2 in series with 220 ohm resistor
*    DIO 09      -->  LED 3 in series with 220 ohm resistor
*    DIO 10      -->  LED 4 in series with 220 ohm resistor
*    DIO 11      -->  LED 5 in series with 220 ohm resistor
